# Weekends

The "Weekends Solved" program is a Python script designed to count the number of Saturdays and Sundays between two given dates, D1 and D2.
Both D1 and D2 are provided in string format, e.g., "8 Feb 2021."
Input the two dates (D1 and D2) when prompted. Use the format "8 Feb 2021."
The program will calculate and display the count of Saturdays and Sundays between the specified dates.
